# DelayedTicTackToe
My own take on ticktacktoe where you make your moves before ever seeing the board.  I made this after deciding I wanted to mess around with the queue data structure.


Rules of the Game:
    1. This isn't your usual game of tictactoe.  Choices for where to put your X or O will all be made before any are displayed on the board.  Depending on if you choose to play by allowing the two players to see each other's inputs or not, this makes it into a game of memorization or luck, respectively.  Things can become harder if the game progresses past the first round as both players must remember the board while choosing their new input.
    2. Enter your input in the following format(x is the row number and y is the column number): (x,y)
    3. Player 1 is X while Player 2 is O.
